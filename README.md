AI Contextual Chatbot

Abstract

This project aims to develop an AI chatbot tailored for the Cyber Security sector. Chatbots are increasingly adopted across various industries and educational institutions, such as “Make My Trip” and “Lovely Professional University.” Our project focuses on creating a chatbot specifically for the Cyber Security field. This chatbot is designed not only to provide company-related information but also to address fundamental security-related queries.

Introduction

Chatbots are AI-driven systems capable of interacting with users or customers, depending on their application. They represent a blend of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies. As technology advances rapidly, industries are automating processes to enhance service quality. Chatbots are a notable example of such automation.

There are two main types of chatbots:

Command-based Chatbots: These operate based on predefined rules, handling a limited range of queries. Users must select specific options to proceed.

Intelligent/AI Chatbots: These utilize Machine Learning and Natural Language Understanding to interpret user input and adapt over time. They can interact through text, speech, or graphical interfaces.

In this project, we developed an AI chatbot focused on the Cyber Security industry. It is trained to address not only basic company-related inquiries but also fundamental cyber security questions.

Literature Review

AI chatbots are widely adopted across various industries, relying on concepts like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Networks. Numerous methods and libraries are available for chatbot development in Python, such as “ChatterBot.” One blog by Edureka outlines how ChatterBot can be utilized [1]. We employed a different approach, using TensorFlow and TFLearn to build our neural network [2]. Additionally, we consulted resources from “The AI University” YouTube channel for further guidance [3].

Methodology

Our methodology is straightforward. We applied Natural Language Processing techniques and developed a custom neural network using TFLearn. Training was performed using a JSON file named “intents.json,” which contains sample dialogues categorized under different “tags.” This file, created by our team, includes basic cyber security-related conversations and terminology. The file was used to train our model with TFLearn’s fit() method, and the trained model was saved as “model.tflearn.” The training data is stored in a file called “training_data,” which is used for generating responses.

Results and Discussion

The AI chatbot demonstrates its intelligence by responding accurately to questions, even if they vary from the training data. It maintains contextual relevance in its responses based on the user’s input.

Conclusion

We conclude that chatbots built with NLP and Neural Networks offer greater efficiency compared to those created using predefined libraries. AI chatbots can save time and labor, providing effective 24/7 service.
